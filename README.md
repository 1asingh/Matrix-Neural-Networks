# Matrix-Neural-Networks
The Matlab source demo code for Matrix Neural Networks

For technical details please see our paper "Matrix Neural Networks" by Junbin Gao, Yi Guo, Zhiyong Wang at https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03805.

The starting point is MatNet_demo.m. 

It is based on MNIST data set. 
The matrix neural network demonstrated is fixed: 

input layer: 28 x 28

hidden layer 1: 20 x 20

hidden layer 2: 16 x 16

Output layer: 10 neurons

The optimisation parameters are in Options section in MatNet_demo.m

NOTE: unzip train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz in ./data/ to get the training images.
